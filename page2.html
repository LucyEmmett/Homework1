    Of all the shades of purple, lavender is that which is most associated with lesbians and the LGBTQ community as a whole. 
    <br><br>
    An example of this is “The Lavender Song” (“Das Lila Lied”), an anthem of pride that emerged in 1920s Berlin.
    <br><br>
    There’s also the alleged lesbian dress codes of the 1920s, where  “sprigs of violets” signalled a woman’s love for other women.
    <br><br>
    Gay men were referred to as “Lavender boys” in the 1920s as they were seen to be “not masculine enough.”
    <br>
    Surprisingly in 1926, a biography of Abraham Lincoln described him as possessing “a streak of lavender”, implying homosexual tendencies (or perhaps bisexuality in a modern reading).
    <br><br>
    In 1970, the Lavender Menace lesbian activist group stormed the stage of the Second Congress to Unite Women wearing t-shirts that said "Lavender Menace" ; they were responding to famous feminist Betty Friedan’s comment that lesbians were a “lavender menace” that would undermine the women’s movement!
